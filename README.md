# Learn Angular and build an interesting project

This project was created when I learned Angular. 

This project is to build a recipe book which connect recipes with shopping lists.

Users could create new recipes to add the name, image and description.

Users could manage(update and delete) recipes.

Users could add the ingredients from the recipe to a shopping list.

Users could manage the shopping list by creating new ingredients, updating ingredients or delete ingredients.

Thanks a lot to my instructor Max!
